BIG POGRESS MADE


**Ignore Below**
~~Solver 1~~

~~Basically, we be having the extension identify the question (after hours of me scanning the html), then we gonna run it into some big companies AI API to solve it
End goal is to have it give the answer right away (or at least something useable???)~~

~~So far, got it to identify sub/superscript (SScript) by checking the change in font, since regular is usually like 15px while the SScripts are 12px~~

~~Next trying to get fractions by checking the positioning of the numbers.~~

~~Got fractions working by finally after like hours. Now I gotta get things in the aleks API or whatever they're using, to get things like sqrts and stuff how am i meant to do this somebody help me~~~
~~Only works with some of them like wtf I need to do more fraction work?~~



~~Copied from Aleks, should work better here since it uses images for the symbols like square roots, unlike Aleks which has the things all hidden and made more complex.~~
